                <p class="p01">The lip-smacking taste of Litti Chokha, savoured by one and all, needs no introduction.
                    It is your grand welcome to the food of Bihar, in all its ghee-dripping glory. It consists of wheat
                    and sattu with spices, kneaded into round spicy balls, dipped in ghee. The texture of Litti along
                    with the crunchy crust makes it a foodie’s delight. Chokha is prepared by mashing boiled vegetables
                    (most common being potatoes, brinjal, tomatoes), adding spices and chopped onion, garlic etc and
                    served with Litti as a complimentary delicacy.

                    Sattu or fried gram flour forms a distinctive element of Bihari food and cuisine. The sattu is mixed
                    with spices and filled in wheat dough balls, rolled and cooked with ghee on a hot plate to form
                    sattu paratha which is also called makuni.

                    <br>
                    This is the most famous food in Bihar.

                    class="img01">
                <p class="p01">Malpua is a traditional North Indian sweet of sugar syrup coated pancakes made with
                    all-purpose flour, curd (yogurt), spices, khoya (dried milk solids) and topped with nuts. Malpua
                    recipe is often made during festivals, special occasions and are a street food as well. Soft and
                    fluffy on the inside, yet crisp and lacy on the outside, these syrup dipped pancakes are a real
                    treat especially when you serve them with Rabri!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Making malpua recipe at home can be a very time-consuming endeavor; many recipes call for the batter
                    to be fermented overnight. In my fluffy version of this delightful Indian sweet, I have opted to
                    omit the long fermenting time and replace it with some leavening.

                    As a result, this yummy recipe can be made in just over an hour. Malpua does have a slight tang to
                    them as the batter is either fermented or made with curd (yogurt).

                    The method for making malpua generally calls for deep-frying the pancakes in ghee. While I stuck to
                    ghee because of its high smoke point and nutty flavor, I opted to shallow fry the pancakes instead,
                    which requires far less fat.

                    Once you try making my simple recipe for quick malpua, I’m fairly certain you’ll fall in love with
                    this dessert. Now let’s get to the kitchen!

                    ingredients properly.

                    Knead the stiff dough using ¼ cup of lukewarm full cream milk and mash the dough between your palms
                    to bind it.

                    Take a dough lump and bind it between your palms. For binding, roll it between your palms and use
                    the moulds of thekua to give it a desired shape or pattern.

                    Place it on the round mould and press by keeping it on the table top. Roll a straight sough lump and
                    place it on the longer mould. Again, press it by keeping it on the table top. If you don’t have the
                    mould then, take a dough lump, roll it, press it and poke it using a fork.

                <p class="p01">The south Asian variety is made by deep-frying maida flour (plain flour or all-purpose
                    flour) batter in pretzel or circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. Jalebi is eaten
                    with curd or rabri (in North India) along with optional other flavors such as kewra (scented water).
                    <br>
                    In some west Asian cuisines, jalebi may consist of a yeast dough fried and then dipped in a syrup of
                    honey and rose water.[citation needed] The North African dish of Zalabia uses a different batter and
                    a syrup of honey (Arabic: asal) and rose water.

                    Jalebi can be served warm or cold. They have a somewhat chewy texture with a crystallized sugary
                    exterior coating. Citric acid, lime juice and rose water is sometimes added to the syrup. Similar
                    but distinct dishes include imarti, chhena jalebi, lokma, zalabiyeh, and bamiyeh. To keep it crisp
                    and to prevent it from getting soggy, commercially made Jalebi has Rangkat (which is Sodium

                    delicacy of Bihari food. The gravy (Kadhi)as well as the badi are prepared from besan (gram flour).
                    The gravy also consists of yoghurt. It is usually complimented with rice and/or puris.</p>

                    an opulent affair of the food of Bihar. Rasia is famous for its festive touch and equally delicious
                    taste. Another variant is made from popped fox nuts or makhana which is called makhane ki kheer and

                    an addition to the food of Bihar through Bengal! Made from mawa, sugar and milk, Pantuas are
                    elongated and have a little harder crust, but are an equally fantastic option to end your perfect

                    is made of flour and salt, deep fried in oil and dipped in sugar syrup. The sugar syrup cools off
                    and crystallizes to give a powedery outer texture. If you use rice flour dough and a thick jaggery
                    syrup, you get another variant called Laktho. Both of them are really sumptuous to munch on.</p>

                <p class="p01">To those of you who enjoy a sugar rush a dive into Bihari cuisine will be worth it. This
                    north Indian state has a plethora of desserts and savouries which will be a delight to your
                    sweetened taste buds. A feeling which you are too sure to relinquish for days to come. However, it
                    requires skill and talent to create the choicest of Bihari sweets. One such sweet that requires
                    careful preparation is the Tilkut a healthy dessert prepared from punched sesame seeds. It is cooked
                    with a sugar base rolled into a ball filled with copious amounts of crushed sesame seeds. The tilkut
                    gets tastier, softer and nebulous with a luxurious input of sesame seeds. Heated in an optimum
                    temperature with the right proportions of jaggery and lint is then hammered where the hard work
                    begins to beat them into biscuit like shapes. The best tilkuts are made in the town of Gaya.
                    However, take care Tilkut is a seasonal dish and it is available only in winters (during Makar
                    Sankranti time). The saying Winter is coming can be never be looked forward more optimistically
                    except in the matter of Tilkuts.</p>

                    diversity we induct into our cuisine. Give us whole wheat flour or any other form of grain, and we
                    will give you lip-smacking platters of breads tagging with the choicest of side dishes. Every state
                    in India has its very own variant of bread, but the small round deep-fried bread called poori is
                    widely known and can be seen in every common household for breakfast. Poori is a very accommodating
                    kind of bread, and poori differs from region to region with various gratings and mashes incorporated
                    into it which dovetails the lusciousness of the bread, and that was withheld from the side dish that
                    is served alongside. When it comes to Bihar it is more of a staple diet to the indigenous population
                    and Bihari cuisine is one of a kind with its exquisiteness. The most common format of Poori there is
                    tagged with the vegan Aaloo sabzi which is mashed potato with a delightful concoction of spices and
                    herbs. The Bihar version of Poori is not complete without the special dessert of jalebi which gives
                    a very healthy and balanced gastronomical.</p>
