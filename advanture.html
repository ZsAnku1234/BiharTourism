                    adrenaline rushing activity. Try your hands on a compressed powered gun that ejects paint filled

                    while crossing various different passages along an arena.

                    The capsules break afterring hitting the spots, which is considered as a point against the opposite
                    team. The paintball arena consists of various obstacles which are required to be passed through to
                    complete this lap.
