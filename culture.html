                    It is made up of two words namely- "Bhai" meaning brother and "Dooj" meaning the second day after
                    the new moon which is a day of its celebration. The day holds the special significance into the
                    lives of a brother and a sister.

                    There is a unique understanding between a brother and a sister. They are the best friends of each
                    other, protectors of each other, admirers of each other, secret sharers of each other and has

                    It is difficult to decode the feelings, emotions and love between siblings. However, there are
                    special days or occasions that are dedicated to strengthening the love between a brother and a
                    sister. Bhaiya Dooj is one such occasion that can define the eternal love between different siblings
                    (brother and sister). This wonderful festival is an important occasion where sisters pray to God for

                <p class="p01">Santoshi Maa is a Hindu goddess, who is venerated as "the Mother of Satisfaction", the
                    meaning of her name. Santoshi Mata is particularly worshipped by women of North India and Nepal. A
                    vrata (ritual fast) called the Santoshi Maa vrata performed by women on 16 consecutive Fridays wins
                    the goddess' favour.
                    <br>
                    Santoshi Mata emerged as a goddess in the early 1960s. Her prayer initially spread through word of
                    mouth, vrata-pamphlet literature, and poster art. Her vrata was gaining popularity with North Indian
                    women. However, it was the 1975 Bollywood film Jai Santoshi Maa ("Hail to Santoshi Maa")—narrating
                    the story of the goddess and her ardent devotee Satyavati—which propelled this then little-known
                    "new" goddess to the heights of devotional fervour. With the rising popularity of the film, Santoshi
                    Mata entered the pan-Indian Hindu pantheon and her images and shrines were incorporated in Hindu
                    temples. The film portrayed the goddess to be the daughter of the popular Hindu god Ganesha and
                    related her to the Raksha Bandhan festival, however, it had no basis in Hindu scriptures.
